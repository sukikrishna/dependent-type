# dependent-type
For CS2520R Assignment 1

Have two parts to this assignment

The first part is 'dependent.py' which should be a close implementation of the semantic model for implementing Dependent Types
Can run this code by cloning the repository and running 'python dependent.py' locally.

Optionally, there is a separate semantic model for implementing polymetric polymorphism, and the corresponding type set as a PDF.
