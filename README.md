# dependent-type
For CS2520R Assignment 1

Have two parts to this assignment

The first part is 'dependent.py' which should be a close implementation of the semantic model for implementing Dependent Types
Can run this code by cloning the repository and running 'python dependent.py' locally.

Unrelated to the dependently typed assignment, but there is included a separate semantic model for implementing polymetric polymorphism using STLC and the corresponding type set as a PDF.
